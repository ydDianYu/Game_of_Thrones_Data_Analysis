# game-of-thrones-data-analysis
This ongoing data analysis project explores datasets about *A Song of Ice and Fire*, the series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin. As a big fan of the books as well as the HBO adaptation *Game of Thrones*, I hope to find exciting insights through this personal project.

The datasets can be found here at https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones.
