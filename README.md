# Game of Thrones Battles Analysis
This project explores battles in *A Song of Ice and Fire*, the series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin. As a big fan of the books as well as the HBO adaptation *Game of Thrones*, I am excited to use data analysis to find interesting insights about the fantasy world.

It goes without saying that this project contains spoilers :)
